# ResQCart: Food Waste Prediction & Rescue Network

## The Big Picture

ResQCart is an AI-powered system that predicts food waste 3-7 days before it happens and automatically triggers a "rescue cascade" to save products, recover revenue, and feed communities.

### Why This Wins

- **Massive Business Impact:** $720M annual savings for retailers
- **Social Good:** 50M meals rescued for food banks
- **Technical Innovation:** Predictive AI + real-time dynamic pricing
- **Scalable Solution:** Clear path from pilot to 4,700+ stores

## The Problem (By The Numbers)

| Current State | Our Solution |
|---------------|--------------|
| $2B+ lost annually to food waste | $720M saved (40% reduction) |
| Reactive markdowns when food is already spoiling | Predictive alerts 3-7 days ahead |
| 80% of near-expiry food goes to landfill | 70% rescued through our cascade system |
| Missed revenue opportunities | $180M recovered through dynamic pricing |
| 38M Americans face food insecurity | 50M meals redirected to communities |

## How It Works

### The AI Prediction Engine

- **Inputs:** Sales data, weather, local events, historical patterns
- **Output:** "Product X will waste in 4 days with 89% confidence"
- **Action:** Trigger rescue protocol automatically

### The Rescue Cascade (7-Day Countdown)

- **Day 7-5:** 🔄 Rebalance inventory between stores
- **Day 4-3:** 💰 Dynamic pricing (15-30% off) + customer alerts
- **Day 2-1:** 🤝 Food bank pickups + employee discounts
- **Day 0:** ⚡ Flash sales (70% off) + final rescue
